The internet already has rules for search engines.  
For decades, `robots.txt` has guided crawlers on what pages to index and what to ignore.  

But with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) — which don’t just index content, but *consume and generate* from it — a new question has emerged:

**How can website owners set rules for AI models?**  
Enter: `llm.txt`.

## 🤔 What is `llm.txt`?

`llm.txt` is a proposed standard, similar to `robots.txt`, that lives at the root of your website (`example.com/llm.txt`).  

Its role is to communicate **guidelines for LLMs, AI crawlers, and agents** that interact with your content. Instead of focusing on search engine indexing, it covers **AI-specific use cases**, like training, summarization, or attribution.

## 🔑 Why Does It Matter?

As AI becomes part of everyday browsing and research, LLMs increasingly pull from live websites. Website owners need:

- **Transparency** → Decide how their content is used by AI.  
- **Control** → Allow some use cases (like summaries) but block others (like training).  
- **Attribution** → Require that models reference or link back to the source.  
- **Fairness** → Help balance AI innovation with creator rights.

## 🛠️ How to Use `llm.txt`

1. **Create the file** in the root of your domain:  

```

[https://example.com/llm.txt](https://example.com/llm.txt)

````

2. **Add your rules.** A simple example:

```txt
# Allow AI to read and summarize content
Allow: summarize

# Disallow training on this website’s content
Disallow: train

# Require attribution when content is used
Attribution: required
````

3. **Publish it** — once the file is live, AI crawlers that follow the standard can read and respect your preferences.

## 📂 Example `llm.txt`

Here’s what a practical version might look like:

```txt
# llm.txt for ExampleSite

# AI crawlers may:
Allow: read
Allow: summarize

# But may NOT:
Disallow: train
Disallow: commercial-use

# Attribution rules
Attribution: link
Contact: webmaster@example.com
```

## 🌍 The Bigger Picture

* **For creators:** `llm.txt` is a way to say *yes* to AI while keeping guardrails.
* **For AI developers:** it reduces legal and ethical gray areas by giving clear signals.
* **For the web as a whole:** it’s a step toward making AI integration as standardized as SEO.

## ✅ Wrap-Up

Just as `robots.txt` became a cornerstone of the search era, `llm.txt` could become the **standard for the AI era**.

Even though adoption is still in its early stages, it’s worth keeping an eye on. If you manage a website, experimenting with `llm.txt` now puts you ahead of the curve.

Do you want me to also **draft a forward-looking `llm.txt` spec** (like a recommended set of fields: `Allow`, `Disallow`, `Attribution`, etc.), so you could include it in the post as a “proposed standard”?

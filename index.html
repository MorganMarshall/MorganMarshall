    <h1>Morgan Marshall, Developer & CTO</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Morgan, a passionate developer and father. I enjoy building cool stuff and working with Ableton Live on
        occasion. Learning a bit of visual basic in elementary school, which most people haven't even heard of, would
        spark a seed that wouldn't manifest itself for many years. Spending a great deal of my career as a hardware
        technician I didn't touch any code again until only a few years ago.</p>
